# DQN Projects
To be written

The goal of this repository is to show some projects I have been working on in my free time. 
Currently I am implementing a DQN to play connect four. 
This is done using the PyTorch library, and the code is based on https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html.
